MadBox test


It took me around 3h to finish the test, i was a little unlucky because I didn't have any of the Unity versions that were required for the test, so I spent almost 30 min downloading one of them.

The part that was more difficult for me was the camera movement, specially the rotation, I'm use to use the cinemachine asset for all camera issues, it makes it easier to me and I think the results are so much pretty, so I was not use to make simple camera movement by script. It was a bit of prove and error, but i get it working finally.
As I said the camera part was the most challenging, so I think I can improve in that a lot, also the physics weren't the best, If I had more time I would improve all the collisions so they look more realistic. And also all the graphic part would be much better with some more time.
To make the game better,I would add some cool GUI that gives you more info when you die or win the level. I would add some animations to the character and maybe some other mechanics as jump or crouch, this would make the platform creation much more creative.
I think I've done a good job, I know it isn't any awesome game, but I think I have room to improve and I know it I can do it fast.
